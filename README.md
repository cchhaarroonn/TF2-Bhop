# TF2-Bhop

Just one simple script for bhoping in TF2 although it is probably detected (I played on few servers and didn't get banned) it is fun to use in games with bots or on workshop maps also with bots. You can use it in public matches but u will probably get VAC banned for it but still if you sont mind making new accounts go ahead have fun!

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pymem, colorama and keyboard module. These are only modules that you will need and you can install them through cmd/terminal.

pip install keyboard
```
